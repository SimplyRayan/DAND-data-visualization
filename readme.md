## by Rayan Alharbi


## Dataset

> I choose the Ford GoBike dataset which contains a wide range of trip data variables, which I think can be helpful interesting analyses once it it's wrangled in the appropriate way, once I was done wrangling the data, I had 


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not
> most rides are through the work days where the number of rides in the weekends decreases\
> Most bike rides are by Males 
> Most rides are in the mornings and then in the evening and after noon, with fewer bike rides in the night, this can be the result of users using bikes commute to work.
> In terms of gender, males have slightly lower duration average when compared to other genders 
> - Males average duration: 9.6 mins
> - Females average duration: 10.8 mins
> - Others Average Age: 10.6 mins
> the mean age for all genders is similar across gender 
> - Females average Age 35.1 years
> - Males average Age 36.1 years
> - Others average Age 37.4 years
> Most of the users are subscribers throughout all genders
> for all genders most trip times are at the Morning, afternoon and evening with very few trips at night
> the median duration time of customer's trips is higher than the median of the subscribers trips
> duration of trips on weekends is higher than the duration through the workdays, I think this can people are busier on work days and don't want to be late, but on weekends they can take their time
> average age on workdays is higher than the average age on weekends
> the average agedecreases through the day
> for all workdays the most common trip times are Morning and Evening but on weekends these two time decreases and trips on the Afternoon increases, again I think this is the result of most people using the bikes to commute to work
> for subscriber the average druation is almost the same throughout the week, but for the user type customer the average duration on workdays fluctuates between 13-14 mins for, but on weekends it increases to around 16 mins
> the duration of trips on the night are always lower than other times throughout the week, it also shows slight increase on duration on afternoon rides on the weekend

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most ages of users are from 25-40 and Distribution is right skewed

> Most rides are in the mornings and then in the evening and after noon, with fewer bike rides in the night, this can be the result of users using bikes commute to work

> the median duration time of customer's trips is higher than the median of the subscribers trips

> average age on workdays is higher than the average age on weekends!

> duration of rides on weekends is higher than the duration throug the workdays, I think this can people are busier on work days and don't want to be late, but on weekends they can take their time

> for all workdays the most common trip times are Morning and Evening but on weekends these two time decreases and trips on the Afternoon increases, again I think this is the result of most people using the bikes to commute to work

>for subscriber the average druation is almost the same throughout the week, but for the user type customer the average duration on workdays fluctuates between 13-14 mins for, but on weekends it increases to around 16 mins
